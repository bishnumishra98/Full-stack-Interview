// Q) How to prevent a bot from scraping your publicly available API ?
// A) To prevent a bot from scraping your publicly available API, you can use the following methods:
//    1. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a
//                      specific time frame. This can help prevent bots from making too many requests and scraping
//                      your API.
//    2. Captcha Integration: Integrate CAPTCHA challenges to verify that the user is human and not a bot. This can
//                            help prevent automated scraping by requiring users to solve challenges that are difficult
//                            for bots to pass.
//    3. Creating Honeypots: Create hidden links or forms that are only visible to bots. When a bot interacts with
//                           these elements, you can block or restrict access to your API. This method helps identify
//                           and block bots without affecting legitimate users.
//    4. Obfucating API endpoints: Obfuscate your API endpoints by using encryption, hashing, or other techniques to
//                                 make it harder for bots to discover and scrape your API. This can help protect your
//                                 API from unauthorized access and scraping.
//    5. Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns in API requests that
//                          may indicate bot activity. By monitoring and analyzing request patterns, you can detect and
//                          block bots from scraping your API.
//    6. User Authentication: Require users to authenticate before accessing your API. By implementing user authentication
//                            mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication methods, you can control
//                            access to your API and prevent unauthorized scraping.
